# Embedded-Systems-Experiments
Embedded systems experiments covering topics such as clock selection, GPIO operations, UART serial communication, and more

* exp1: Clock Selection and GPIO Operations
  * exp1_1: Configure system clocks for slow and fast LED blinking.
  * exp1_2: Control LEDs (D1 and D2) with user buttons (USR_SW1 and USR_SW2).
* exp2: A2000TM4 Expansion Board and SYSTICK Interrupts
  * exp2_1: Implement three operating modes controlled by user buttons.
  * exp2_2: Modify functionality to display LED status on the leftmost LED.
  * exp2_3: Implement countdown functionality.
  * exp2_4: Add mode switching and display the current mode on the 7-segment display.
* exp3: Modify the example program for non-blocking UART communication.

* Equipment Needed
  * Computer
  * TM4C1294NCPDT development board
  * Digital oscilloscope
  * A2000TM4 expansion board
  * UART debugging software
 
Please run the code with KEIL uVision5. Also, there are some additional libraries needed, don't forget to add them in the same folder!
